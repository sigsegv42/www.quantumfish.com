Another month into the year means that many more days of 365 pictures. February was filled with rainy days. It's a fact that can be evidenced by the large number 
of shots of (mostly) inanimate household objects. The limited opportunities for shooting excursions often challenged me to find interesting material in my local environment.

There was also ample occasion for pushing my post processing knowledge as well as continuing to develop my skills behind the lens. Humdrum household images 
can be turned into eye catching artistic works with a few adjustments in the digital darkroom. As I learn more about the various develop settings in Lightroom, 
I find myself making a wider range of specific adjustments to my raw images and relying less on the built-in presets.

I also continue to look for additional ways to challenge and develop my shooting skills. One such approach has been to spend more time with different lenses. 
My 24-70mm glass is my daily workhorse. It provides the 50mm sweet spot with a good range of zoom flexibility on either side. As such, it's easy to always 
think of composing shots in that focal range. Spending a few days with just a telephoto lens is a great way to force yourself to rethink your shots and look 
for compositions you might not have otherwise considered.
