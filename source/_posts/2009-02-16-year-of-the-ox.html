The Chinese New Year Parade was started sometime in the 1860's and remains one of the few night illuminated parades in the country. By now it carries 
strong corporate sponsorship, falling under the direction of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce - currently sponsored by Southwest Airlines.

The highlight of the parade is the 200 foot Golden Dragon also known as Gum Lung. It takes a team of over 100 to operate this illuminated monster as it 
winds its way along the parade route.

This year we transition from the Year of the Rat to the Year of the Earth Ox. The Ox is a symbol of prosperity through hard work.
