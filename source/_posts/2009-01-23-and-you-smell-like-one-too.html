Continuing the field testing of my new Mark II, I decided to check off another item on my list of must visit locations and headed to the San Francisco Zoo. 
Getting there is a fairly trivial task - a simple matter of hopping on an outbound Muni L Taraval LRV and taking it all the way to the end. The line ends 
near the Great Highway which runs parallel to Ocean Beach right next to the zoo. The zoo is spread out over 125 acres and is home to around 250 different animal species.

The zoo is divided into different areas including the African Savanna where you can see the Giraffes, Zebras, Ostriches and a variety other species. 
The Bear Grottos are home to the Grizzly, and Polar Bears while the Family Farm offers an all ages petting zoo including sheep, goats, and miniature donkeys. 
As well as having the opportunity to feed animals directly, several other daily feedings by the zoo staff can be watched at designated times around the zoo. 
A favorite of both the crowd and the gulls is the afternoon feeding of the Magellanic penguins at the Penguin Island.
