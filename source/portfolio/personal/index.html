<p>These are all of the projects I have worked on in my spare time for myself (such as this website), friends, or as learning experiences.</p>

	<h4>rpi-ferment</h4>
	<p>This is a beer fermentation temperature monitoring, logging, and control application suite built on the Raspberry Pi platform.  There are a series of <a href="/blog/2013/04/20/raspberry-pi-pt-1/">blog posts</a> detailing the entire project.  The software aspect comprises two Node.js applications written in CoffeeScript.  The <a href="https://github.com/sigsegv42/rpi-ferment">backend</a> server interacts with the Pi's GPIO, capturing temperature data from any number of configured DS18B20 temperature sensors and logging them into graphite via statsd.  It also exposes a RESTful API built using Express and Mongoose for managing fermentation profiles.  A Socket.io server is also integrated for managing the controller.  The <a href="https://github.com/sigsegv42/rpi-ferment-frontend">frontend application</a> provides a UI for displaying graphs of logged temperature data, managing profiles, and interacting with the backend.  It is built using <a href="https://github.com/SimbCo/brunch-with-marionette">Brunch with Marionette</a> and served with a thin static Node.js server.</p>

	<h4>http://www.bottletheory.com/</h4>
	<p>This currently ongoing project extends on concepts explored in the original tQF website and Basil application frameworks along with ideas based on various other project research. The genesis began as a conversation among friends in September 2009 about a hypothetical application that could be used as a tool to track and log information about the various beers a person had tried.  This original concept has slowly developed into the basis for a social game platform with a feature set including lists, check ins, and achievements. It represents the culmination of my current ideas and best practices in building a modern social web platform - It is truly for the love of beer and web technology. Among the components it leverages, LAMP, Amazon Web Services, Lucene/Solr, ActiveMQ, Doctrine ORM, Zend Framework, jQuery AJAX, REST JSON services.</p>

	<h4>http://www.quantumfish.com/</h4>
	<p>The original <a href="/archive/2009/">http://www.quantumfish.com</a> website ran a lightweight custom-built MVC framework written in PHP.  It originally used <a href="http://adodb.sourceforge.net/">ADOdb</a> for database connectivity.  The final version provided database access using <a href="http://qcu.be/">QCubed</a>'s ORM system implemented as a framework plugin. The current iteration of this website is built using the <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> blogging framework.</p>

	<h4><a href="http://basil.quantumfish.com/">Mystery Basket Generator</a></h4>
	<p>The original basil project was a grand vision that never existed beyond the initial prototype phase.  This reincarnation is a stripped down weekend project version is a simple randomized ingredient mystery basket generator inspired by shows such as the Food Network's Chopped series.  It is a Node.js application built using the Express framework and MongoDB data store.  The <a href="https://github.com/sigsegv42/basil">source</a> is hosted on Github.</p>

	<h4>http://basil.quantumfish.com/</h4>
	<p>This is a cookbook/kitchen/food management type web application prototyped with the CakePHP framework. It also used the script.acul.us AJAX library.</p>

	<h4>http://www.darkclown.com/ + http://www.clanversus.com/</h4>
	<p>For darkclown.com I provided the layout and design for the PHP-Nuke based CMS. I also managed the hosting and applied updates as they became available. Over the years I have 
		provided several site layouts for the ClanVersus gaming group website, built a complete modular portal/CMS from scratch, managed site hosting, and provided software upgrades 
		to the highly customized phpbb based forums and mediawiki installation.</p>
