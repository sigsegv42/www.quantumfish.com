<p>These are all of the projects I have worked on in my spare time for myself (such as this website), friends, or as learning experiences.</p>

<div class="project_box">
	<h4>http://www.bottletheory.com/</h4>
	<p>This currently ongoing project extends on concepts explored in the original tQF website and Basil application frameworks along with ideas based on various other project 
		research. The genesis began as a conversation among friends in September 2009 about a hypothetical application that could be used as a tool to track and log information 
		about the various beers a person had tried.  This original concept has slowly developed into the basis for a social game platform with a feature set including lists, 
		check ins, and achievements. It represents the culmination of my current ideas and best practices in building a modern social web platform - It is truly for the love of 
		beer and web technology. Among the components it leverages, LAMP, Amazon Web Services, Lucene/Solr, ActiveMQ, Doctrine ORM, Zend Framework, jQuery AJAX, REST JSON services.</p>

	<h4>http://www.quantumfish.com/</h4>
	<p>The original <a href="/archive/2009/">http://www.quantumfish.com</a> website ran a lightweight custom-built MVC framework written in PHP.  It originally used 
		<a href="http://adodb.sourceforge.net/">ADOdb</a> for database connectivity.  The final version provided database access using <a href="http://qcu.be/">QCubed</a>'s 
		ORM system implemented as a framework plugin.</p>

<div class="project_box">
	<h4>http://www.darkclown.com/ + http://www.clanversus.com/</h4>
	<p>For darkclown.com I provided the layout and design for the PHP-Nuke based CMS. I also managed the hosting and applied updates as they became available. Over the years I have 
		provided several site layouts for the ClanVersus gaming group website, built a complete modular portal/CMS from scratch, managed site hosting, and provided software upgrades 
		to the highly customized phpbb based forums and mediawiki installation.</p>
