<p>
	As the lead web developer at Jesscom.net I was involved with the development of dozens of sites. The projects ranged from simple static brochure type designs 
	to full portals with complex backend systems and multiple integrative components. Most of the backend development was done with ColdFusion and MS SQL.

	<h4>http://www.e1051.fm/ + http://www.hot1067.com/ + http://www.rockthis.com/ + http://www.kncycountry.com/</h4>
	<p>
		These were portal websites for several local/regional radio stations owned by the parent company. While layout and design were handled by our in-house web 
		design staff, I provided all of the backend code for dynamic content generation as well as front-end AJAX-style JavaScript programming. These sites also 
		incorporated real-time information about songs currently being played on-air. This required additional network (Windows/Service/C++) application programming 
		in order to extract the data from the studio tracking software and import it into the website backend.

	<h4>http://www.dare2care.net/ + http://www.kcdare2care.com/</h4>
	<p>
		The Dare2Care sites were local charity / volunteer sites supported by our parent company. I implemented the features allowing organizations to post about 
		volunteering opportunities and for volunteers to search that information.

<div class="project_box">
	<h4>http://www.417jobline.com/ + http://www.careersinfood.com/</h4>
	<p>
		These were local job posting boards for which I implemented all of the basic features you would typically find on most employment targetted websites.

	<h4>The Others</h4>
	<p>
		There are a number of other sites that I also facilitated the development of in some minor capacity. This is a collection of screenshots from a few of those sites.
