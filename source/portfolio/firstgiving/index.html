<p>
At <a href="http://developers.firstgiving.com/">FirstGiving.com</a> I worked with a team building a suite of tools used for processing donations for Non Profit Organizations.  The applications included RESTful web API's for searching over 2 million organizations and performing donation transaction processing, an embeddable button widget with a popup donation window, a Facebook donation application, and backend reporting and analytics tools.  My work included backend and frontend feature implementation, 3rd party partner support, documentation, and long term application maintenance.  I was also charged with all of the application deployment and server management tasks.  As the primary engineer in charge of AWS-based server infrastructure, I designed and managed the server deployments and developed the application deployment tools and procedures.
