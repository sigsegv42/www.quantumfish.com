My 2+ year role as a senior engineer for minted.com began shortly prior to launch. Over the several following years, the site has grown into a 
successful high-end online stationery business. During my time here I've contributed many significant key features as well as overall site 
improvements. The work has ranged from defining core API and site architecture components and implementing core e-commerce and social platform 
features, to server configuration, monitoring, deployment, and administration. Some of the feature work includes:

<ul>
	<li>
		Promotional engine capabilities
	</li>
	<li>
		Cart and checkout features
	</li>
	<li>
		Product format & feature implementation
	</li>
	<li>
		Product customization abilities
	</li>
	<li>
		Delivery estimator tool
	</li>
	<li>
		3rd party API integrations with Twitter, Facebook, Cybersource, Serena, Amazon
	</li>
</ul>
