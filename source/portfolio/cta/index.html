<p>My work at CTA had me building websites that were for the most part targeted at freight transportation needs. A few, such as lhptransport.com and ctatechs.com were 
	primarily static design jobs. Most, however, were complex web applications powered by a LAMP (Linux+Apache+MySQL+PHP) stack.</p>
    <br />
<div class="project_box">
	<h4>http://www.ctatechs.com/ + http://www.lhptransport.com/</h4>
	<p>These were simple static corporate websites. I provided all of the site layout and design. The HTML and CSS were hand coded with a small amount of PHP on the backend 
		utilized for the common header, footer, and navigation elements. The original content was largely MS Office generated and required a good deal of hand reformatting 
		to be standards comformant.</p>

	<h4>http://www.loadmover.com/ + http://prime.loadmover.com/ + http://www.loadmax.com/</h4>
	<p>This site was a complex web application designed to be used in the transportation logistics industry. Its initial purpose was to help match LTL truck carriers with 
		available loads from shippers. Over the course of the development a number of other useful tools were added. The project also became the base code for several sister 
		sites including Prime, Inc.'s customized version and the commercial version available through LoadMax.com. Some features included:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>3rd party data integration - retrieving, parsing, and importing EDI formatted data from AS400 mainframes for website display</li>
		<li>3rd party application integration - fetching LTL rates from Linux network service utilizing a XML-RPC middleware solution</li>
		<li>Building custom Bill of Lading forms and generating printable PDF document versions on the fly</li>
		<li>Advanced search capabilities including complex distance and radius location calculations</li>
		<li>Customizable automated search agents providing specific matches via email</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>LHP Agents Xtranet</h4>
	<p>The Agents Xtranet project provided a toolset for contracted logistics agents located throughout the country. The tools included data management for trucks, loads, and 
		contacts for each agent. Data could be imported/exported from MS Excel via common CSV type formats. A document storage system for managing images of scanned documents 
		such as Bill of Lading forms was also incorporated into the system. User access was controlled through a detailed ACL framework.</p>

	<h4>http://www.dats.us/ + http://www.transbids.com/</h4>
	<p>These were uncompleted / scrapped projects that underwent some degree of internal development but were never publicly launched. The dats.us website was designed to 
		become a directory of transportation industry service providers with a focus on minority owned businesses. The Transbids.com project was meant to provide a system for 
		logistics companies to easily complete bid proposals on lanes provided by shippers (e.g. Kodak, Pepsi, Quaker). The system would function similar to a auction or RFP 
		type tool, automating winning bid selections.</p>
