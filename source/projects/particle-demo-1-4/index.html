	This is my original OpenGL game engine demo project. This release is based on approximately 15K lines of object-oriented C++ implementing some basic game engine features 
	such as tga texture loading, 2D fonts, a particle system, command console, multitextured skybox, Quake 2 and Milkshape 3D model loading, scene antialiasing, and a 
	command/event binding system.
