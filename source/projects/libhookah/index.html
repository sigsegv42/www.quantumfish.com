	This is the common library used in pong, tetris, et al. It is written in modern C++ and utilizes features from the standard library and boost libraries. 
	While it began as a single engine library, it is currently organized into a collection of small libraries. Each library provides a limited collection of 
	services - config file parsing, abstract input device and event handling, concrete SDL binding, 3D data types, fonts, sound support. External dependencies 
	include OpenAL for sound, SDL for video and input, and QuantumXML for config files.
