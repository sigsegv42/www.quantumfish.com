<p>
	The v3dlibs project is a collection of C++ application libaries used across my various 3D application projects.  There are libraries for image reading &amp; writing (PNG, TGA, BMP, JPEG), font rendering (bmfont, FreeType), OpenAL audio, basic 3D data types, an event framework, OpenGL rendering helpers, and backend window drivers for SDL, SDL2, FLTK, and SMFL.
