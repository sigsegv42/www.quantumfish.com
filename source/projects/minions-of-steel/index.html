	This is an independent RTS (with some FPS elements mixed in) game project which I am contributing coding work on (porting from Ogre 1.2 to 1.4, 
	level/scene loading, input handling, collision detection, camera controls, etc). It is built on the Ogre3D game engine and uses a number of other 
	components such as OIS for input, CEGUI for UI support, tinyxml for XML parsing, etc.
