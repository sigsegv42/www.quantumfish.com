Originally hailing from southwest Missouri, I currently call San Francisco my home. I have a passion for code and the design of software platforms. Once upon a time my day job was as a senior application engineer for a small startup called <a href="http://www.minted.com">Minted.com</a>.  There we pioneered the concept of high-end crowd-sourced print-on-demand stationery through the form of a socialized e-commerce platform.  After that I moved on to become an ops engineer for the west coast branch of the <a href="http://developers.firstgiving.com/">FirstGiving.com</a> group.

Much of my spare time is taken up by my growing <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/quantumfish">photography</a> and <a href="http://itenerancy.com/">beer brewing</a> obsessions as well as my various other engineering <a href="http://quantumfish.com/portfolio/">side</a> <a href="http://quantumfish.com/projects/">projects</a>.
