Originally hailing from southwest Missouri, I currently call San Francisco my home. I have a passion for code and the design of software platforms. 
Once upon a time my day job was as a senior application engineer for a small startup called <a href="http://www.minted.com">Minted.com</a>.  
There we pioneered the concept of high-end crowd-sourced print-on-demand stationery through the form of a socialized e-commerce platform.  
These days I'm an ops engineer for the west coast branch of the <a href="http://www.firstgiving.com/">FirstGiving.com</a> group.

Much of my spare time is taken up by my growing <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/quantumfish">photography</a> obsession as well as my various other engineering 
<a href="http://quantumfish.com/portfolio/">side</a> <a href="http://quantumfish.com/projects/">projects</a>.

And then there's beer. Of the many things I've learned since that fateful day I decided to head west, an appreciation of good beer ranks up there 
on the list. I had come from a background in the midwest that is dominated by the big macrobrewers. Craft beers and microbrewing hadn't yet fully 
taken hold in those parts. I didn't think I really liked beer -  and then I learned about the likes of Mendocino, Stone, Rogue, Lagunitas. This new 
appreciation eventually led to yet another interest - <a href="http://itenerancy.com/">homebrewing</a>. I'm still in the early stages 
with only a handful of batches under my belt. I'm not even that good at it yet, but I'm having fun, learning, and writing about it as I go.
